## üêù Spelling Bee React

A React-based clone of the popular **New York Times Spelling Bee** game. This version does not include new daily words; instead, it features a single static word for testing purposes. The words are stored inside a useState hook, making it easy to modify and extend the game to support dynamic word updates.
